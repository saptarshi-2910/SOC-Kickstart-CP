# üìò Week 2: Sorting Algorithms and Practice

## üìå What I Already Knew
- Basics of arrays
- Using built-in `sort()` from C++ STL

## ‚ú® What I Improved
- Gained clarity on how different sorting algorithms work internally
- Learnt to implement sorting algorithms from scratch (without using STL)
- Improved in analyzing and comparing time and space complexities of various techniques

## üìö What I Learnt
- Fundamental sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Divide and Conquer techniques:
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Problem-solving approaches using sorting
- Real-world applications of sorting (like finding kth largest, grouping elements, etc.)

## üìÅ Structure
- Each problem is saved in its own `.cpp` file.
- Sorting algorithm files begin with comments explaining:
  - Algorithm approach
  - Time complexity
  - Space complexity
- File names follow the format: `ProblemName.cpp`
