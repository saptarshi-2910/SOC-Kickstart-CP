# 🌐 Week 4: Graphs

## 📌 What I Already Knew
- Basics of stack and queue
- Simple DFS and BFS concepts from previous learning

## ✨ What I Improved
- Applied DFS and BFS on real graph problems
- Built confidence in graph traversal, adjacency list construction
- Got hands-on with cycle detection and topological sorting

## 📚 What I Learnt
- Graph representation using adjacency list
- Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for connected components
- Cycle detection in:
  - 2D Grid
  - Directed Graphs
  - Undirected Graphs
- Topological Sorting (using Kahn’s Algorithm and DFS)
- Flood Fill Algorithm
- Rotten Oranges problem (multi-source BFS)
- Course Schedule (using topological sort)
- Snake and Ladder (graph modeling + shortest path via BFS)
- Counting all possible paths in DAG (DFS with backtracking)
