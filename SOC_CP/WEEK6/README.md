# 🔴 Week 6: Greedy Algorithms

## 📌 What I Already Knew
- Activity Selection and Knapsack basics
- Idea of making locally optimal choices

## ✨ What I Improved
- Identified greedy-choice and optimal substructure properties
- Understood when greedy fails and when it outperforms DP/brute-force
- Learned how sorting and greedy work together in scheduling problems

## 📚 What I Learnt
- Interval scheduling, Huffman encoding
- Fractional vs 0/1 Knapsack (and why greedy only works for one)
- Greedy applications in:
  - Job scheduling
  - Platform allocation
  - Cost optimization
- Priority-based and greedy sorting techniques

## 🧠 Problems Solved

- ✅ Fractional Knapsack
- ✅ Activity Selection
- ✅ Huffman Encoding
- ✅ Smallest Subset with Sum ≥ Target
- ✅ Swap and Maximize
- ✅ Min Cost to Make Size 1
- ✅ Shop in Candy Store
- ✅ Job Sequencing Problem
- ✅ Merge Overlapping Intervals
- ✅ Minimum Platforms
- ✅ Maximum Trains on a Platform

## 📁 Structure
- Each `.cpp` file is named after the problem
- Logic and complexity analysis included in comments
- Problems organized for readability and easy reference

✅ *All mandatory problems completed successfully for Week 6.*
