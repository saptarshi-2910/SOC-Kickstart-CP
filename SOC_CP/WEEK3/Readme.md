# 🌲 Week 3: Divide and Conquer & Trees

## 📌 What I Already Knew
- Basic recursion concepts
- Simple tree traversal understanding (preorder, inorder)
- Familiarity with matrices

## ✨ What I Improved
- Gained confidence in solving problems using divide and conquer
- Understood how tree-based problems can be approached recursively
- Practiced analyzing tree structures for BST-specific problems

## 📚 What I Learnt
- **Divide and Conquer** techniques and when to apply them
- Applications of recursion in real problems (e.g., inversion count, skyline)
- BST operations: insert, search, traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder)
- How to represent trees and matrices in code
- Techniques like:
  - Counting inversions
  - Binary search in matrices
  - Total union length of intervals
  - Skyline area computation
