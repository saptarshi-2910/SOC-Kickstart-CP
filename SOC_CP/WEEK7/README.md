# 🟤 Week 7: Dynamic Programming

## 📌 What I Already Knew
- Simple recursion and Fibonacci via memoization
- Basic idea of overlapping subproblems

## ✨ What I Improved
- Distinction between subarray, substring, and subsequence
- Clarity in writing tabulation and memoized DP
- Confidence in solving 2D DP and string-based DP problems

## 📚 What I Learnt
- Patterns in 1D and 2D DP problems
- Transition logic in tabulation (bottom-up)
- Recursive-to-DP transformation
- Solving problems like:
  - Decode ways (combinatorics)
  - Edit distance (string alignment)
  - LIS, LCS, Palindrome substring
- When not to use DP (if greedy is optimal)

## 🧠 Problems Solved

### 1D DP
- ✅ Fibonacci Number
- ✅ Tribonacci Number
- ✅ Climbing Stairs
- ✅ Frog Jump
- ✅ House Robber I & II
- ✅ Min Sum Triangle
- ✅ Longest Increasing Subarray

### 2D / String DP
- ✅ Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- ✅ Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- ✅ Edit Distance
- ✅ Longest Common Increasing Subsequence
- ✅ Longest Palindromic Substring
- ✅ Unique Paths
- ✅ Decode Ways
- ✅ Sequence Completion

## 📁 Structure
- Each solution is saved in a `.cpp` file with clear naming
- Code contains inline comments for base cases and transitions

✅ *All recommended problems completed. Strong base for future DP practice.*
