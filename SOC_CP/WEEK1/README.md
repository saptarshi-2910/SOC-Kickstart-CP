# Week 1: C++ STL and Binary Search

## What I Already Knew:
- Basics of C++ syntax and simple programming constructs
- Familiarity with arrays and loops

## What I Improved:
- Understood C++ STL: vectors, sets, maps, and pairs
- Implemented binary search variations effectively
- Improved speed and confidence in solving standard array problems

## What I Learnt:
- Binary search models and edge cases
- Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm
- Kadane’s Algorithm for maximum subarray sum
- LeetCode problem-solving strategies
- Two-pointer technique and where to apply it

## Problems Solved:
### Arrays:
1. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock  
2. Merge Sorted Array  
3. Majority Element (Boyer-Moore)  
4. Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane’s Algo)  
5. Remove Element  
6. Pascal’s Triangle  

### Binary Search:
7. Square Root of N  
8. Search in Rotated Sorted Array  
9. Minimum Size Subarray  

### Two Pointers:
10. Two Sum  
11. Two Sum II  
12. Palindrome Check  
13. Is Subsequence
