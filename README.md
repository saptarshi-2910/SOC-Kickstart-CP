# SOC Kickstart CP - Midterm Submission

This repository contains my work for **SOC Project ID-43: Kickstart CP** as part of SOC 2025. Over the first four weeks, I completed various coding problems and assignments that helped strengthen my grasp of fundamental Competitive Programming topics using C++.

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

### 🟢 Week 1: C++ STL & Binary Search
- Topics: STL basics, arrays, two pointers, binary search
- Resources: CP Handbook (Ch 1, 2, 3.3, 4), LeetCode problems
- Solved mandatory + most extra questions (except "Container With Most Water")

### 🟡 Week 2: Sorting
- Covered sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick
- Time & space complexities written in code comments
- Also solved problems like Kth largest element, sort colors, intersection, etc.
- Completed all mandatory questions only

### 🟠 Week 3: Divide and Conquer, Binary Trees & BSTs
- Concepts: Inversion count, skyline area, BST insert/search/traversals
- Watched tree traversal videos and referred to learning docs
- Only mandatory problems attempted

### 🔵 Week 4: Graphs
- Topics: DFS, BFS, Disjoint Set, Cycle detection, Topological sort
- Problems: Flood fill, Rotten oranges, Course schedule, Snake & ladder
- Attempted and completed only mandatory problems

## 📌 Learning Highlights

- Improved problem-solving ability using STL and logical structuring
- Understood sorting algorithms deeply and practiced complexity analysis
- Strengthened understanding of recursive functions, binary trees, and graph traversal techniques
- Learned the practical use of disjoint set and topological sorting in CP

## 📘 Each Week's README Covers:

- What I already knew
- What I improved on
- What I learned newly (theoretical + practical)
